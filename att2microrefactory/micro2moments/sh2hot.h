/** 
 * This header file implements the conversion from SH representations
 * of functions defined over the unit sphere to Higher Order Tensor
 * (HOT) representations, back and forth, since SH functions up to 
 * order LMAX span the same functional space as HOT of degree L. 
 * For a reference on this, see:
 * 
 *   M. Descoteaux, E. Angelino, S. Fitzgibbons, and R. Deriche. 
 *   "Apparent Diffusion Profile estimation from High Angular 
 *   Resolution Diffusion Images: estimation and applications."
 *   Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 56(2):395â€“410, 2006.
 * 
 * The evaluation of HOT at desired orientations is also implemented.
